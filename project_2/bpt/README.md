usage:
    r <key> remove key
    i <key> <value> insert key with value
    f <key> find value that matches to the key if existing
    d display current tree
    o <filename> it's okay to input relative or absolute path. 
        but I put getcwd() in main function. so if you are going to absolute path, you will see twice the path.
